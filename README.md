This repository contains two training notebooks for fine-tuning YOLOv12 on a custom Automatic License Plate Detection dataset:

YOLOv12s: lightweight, fast baseline for edge devices.

YOLOv12m: larger backbone for higher accuracy at the cost of speed.

Both notebooks were authored using the Ultralytics training stack and use Roboflow to fetch a dataset. Training in both notebooks is configured for 25 epochs.
